Homework02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Feel free to write a LOT more tests for your programs.  Remember
there is no such thing as "too much testing".  The more you test,
the more likely it will be you'll uncover bugs or errors that you
didn't know about or anticipate.  Your testing is EXTREMELY
anemic -- you guys can do better!  You wouldn't produce a hardware
board without much more thorough testing would you?!
