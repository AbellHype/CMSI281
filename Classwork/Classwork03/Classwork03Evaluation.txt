Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You need to have a header block at the top of your files.
I have specified this over and over, and you are losing points
because of it.  I gave you the one point for the header in the
optional EmptyListException.

scores:
=============================
IntListInterface.java
IntList.java
   getValueAtIndex            [1 pt]
   checkIndex                 [1 pt]
   prepend                    [1 pt]
headers in all files          [2 pt]   no headers = 0 points
code style                    [1 pt]
EmptyListException            [OPTIONAL 1 pt]
