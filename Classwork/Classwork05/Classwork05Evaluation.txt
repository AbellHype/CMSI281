======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You didn't rename the methods to something that is appropriate
to a queue, as stated in the problem.  You did adequate testing
but you can always do more!

scores:
=============================
IntLinkedList.java
   compiles                [1.00]

IntQueue.java
   changed to Queue name   [0.00]  still called "myStack"
   changed to enqueue()    [0.00]  still called "push()"
   changed to dequeue()
      or remove()          [1.00]

IntQueueTester.java
   test coverage (3)       [3.00]

headers(3)                 [3.00]
code style                 [1.00]

total possible points      11 points

you got 9 out of 11 which is 81.82% which is a B-minus
